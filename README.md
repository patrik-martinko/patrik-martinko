I have been programming since childhood. As a child, I liked to play games and wanted to create my own games, so I started to learn object-oriented programming and databases. Later, I wanted to connect players online, so I started to learn about servers, network connections, security. I sold my first game when I was 15 years old.

I am interested in new technology, macroeconomics, open source code, biohacking ...
